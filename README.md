# MNIST ML Exploration
This repo is part of my series on reviewing ML concepts. 
I use PCA, KMeans, and CNN's to analyse the MNIST dataset. Included in each notebook is a detailed set of questions and answers to improve my learning. 

## Results
* PCA + KMeans achieved 58% accuracy using a typical train-test split. Implementation was complex, requiring many manual tranformations
* CNN achieved 98% accuracy, and excelled in the simplicity of the implementation.
